# Live-Project-Summary

## Overview

The Tech Academy concludes course work with a two week live project. This project provides a working environment to gain experience with the many facets of a web development project. Azure was the version control used to host the main repository to create a branch from and push completed sections of code to. Stories were assigned and posted to the boards for students to pick up and complete for our individual components. I utilized Visual Studio Code to write my webpage components. The main website hosted several compenents with unique topics of interest centering around lifestyle. The components were stryled using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The project was kicked-off with a sprint meeting and communication was continued through daily stand ups and through the Discord app. 

## Set Up

## Stories
- Create a component
- Implement a grid system
- Create a sign up form
- Implement form functionality

## Lessons Learned

The live project provided several learning opportunities and challanges. Initially, there was an issue with Visual Studio Code authentication that inihibted the ability to push
code to the main branch. This took patience and teamwork with the project leaders to troubleshoot. In between troubleshooting sessions I continued to work on code that could
be pushed at a later time when the isssue was resolved. This was very similar to real experiences I've encounterd working on civil engineering projects where progress needs to
continue while also working to resolve roadblocks. I was working full-time during this project so I spent most of my time working during evenings and weekends. This was a bit intimidating at first but I'm glad for the time on the weekends where I needed to fine-tune my ability to research through coding and find solutions to bugs on my own.
