# Live-Project-Summary

<br>

## Overview

The Tech Academy concludes course work with a two week live project. This project provided a working environment to gain experience with the many facets of a web development project and exposure to the Agile/Scrum methodology. Azure was the version control used to host the main repository to create a branch from and push completed sections of code to. Stories were assigned and posted to the boards for students to pick up and complete for our individual components. I utilized Visual Studio Code to write my webpage components. The main website hosted several compenents with unique topics of interest centering around lifestyle. The components were stryled using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The project was kicked-off with a sprint meeting and communication was continued through daily stand ups and through the Discord app. 

This project was a great way to end the coursework and I'm motivated to continue learning this craft and expand my skillset.

## Set Up

Prior to the initial sprint I was provided access to the project to review the wiki and follow any instructions to prepare ahead of time. This included installing Live Server, cloning the project, setting up the file structure, and review of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<br>

## Stories
- Create a component utilizing HTML and CSS.
- Implement a grid system with CSS and add interactive design elements such as scroll over effects.
- Create a sign up form that connects to my email.
- Implement form functionality with JavaScript.

## Lessons Learned

The live project provided several learning opportunities and challanges. Initially, there was an issue with Visual Studio Code authentication that inihibted the ability to push
code to the main branch. This took patience and teamwork with the project leaders to troubleshoot. In between troubleshooting sessions I continued to work on code that could
be pushed at a later time when the isssue was resolved. This was very similar to real experiences I've encounterd working on civil engineering projects where progress needs to
continue while also working to resolve roadblocks. I was working full-time during this project so I spent most of my time working during evenings and weekends. This was a bit intimidating at first but I'm glad for the time on the weekends where I needed to fine-tune my ability to research through coding and find solutions to bugs on my own.
